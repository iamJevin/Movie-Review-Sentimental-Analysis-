>Sentiment analysis of movie review in hindi language

Requirements:
1) python3 
2) Scikit-learn
3) Numpy, Pandas
4) NLTK
5) Pickle
6) Codecs

I have used Resource Based Semantic Analysis using HindiSentiWordnet.---> In this approach we used Hindi Sentiwordnet to 
classify the review's sentiment as positive or Negative. I have also created a simple front end using tkinter which has one 
input field of accepting moview review and one output field to display the sentiment.

>Dataset Used:
We have used a total of 1000 Hindi movie reviews for the Sentiment
Analysis. We have taken 250 labeled reviews from the dataset of IIT-
Bombay which contain 125 positive and 125 negative Hindi movie
reviews.
